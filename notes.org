* Notes
I set this lab up with the following commands:
#+begin_src bash
bundle install
rails db:migrate db:seed
rails s
#+end_src

I then installed and ran the React frontend components with the following revisions:
#+begin_src bash
npm install --prefix client
npm start --prefix client
#+end_src

These are the deliverables for this lab:
- Display a list of all the toys
- Add a new toy when the toy form is submitted
- Update the number of likes for a toy
- Donate a toy to Goodwill (and delete it from our database)

I then made the following revisions to the 'app/controllers/toys_controllers.rb' Controllers file to correct the issue of 'json' not being returned from the backend to the 'frontend' properly:
#+begin_src ruby
class ToysController < ApplicationController
  wrap_parameters format: []

  def index
    toys = Toy.all
    render json: toys
  end

  def create
    toy = Toys.create(toy_params)
    render json: toy, status: :created
  end

  def update
    toy = Toy.find_by(id: params[:id])
    toy.update(toy_params)
    # NOTE: This fixed the issue by not returning JSON
    # from the backend to the frontend:
    render json: toy
  end

  def destroy
    toy = Toy.find_by(id: params[:id])
    toy.destroy
    head :no_content
  end

  private

  def toy_params
    params.permit(:name, :image, :likes)
  end

end
#+end_src

I then revised the 'config/routes.rb' routes file with the following revision since the 'app/controllers/toys_controller.rb' controller file did not include the related ':destroy' action:
#+begin_src ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # NOTE: I added the ':destroy' action as it was declared in
  # the associated 'app/controllers/toys_controller.rb' controller
  # file but it wasn't made visible via the routes file,
  # 'config/routes.rb':
  resources :toys, only: [:index, :create, :update, :destroy]
end
#+end_src
